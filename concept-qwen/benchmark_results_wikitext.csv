" Traditional Chinese literary criticism emphasized the life of the author when interpreting a work , a practice which Burton Watson attributes to "" the close links that traditional Chinese thought posits between art and morality "" . Since many of Du Fu 's poems feature morality and history , this practice is particularly important .","Another reason , identified by the Chinese historian William Hung , is that Chinese poems are typically concise , omitting context that might be relevant , but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know . For modern Western readers , "" The less accurately we know the time , the place and the circumstances in the background , the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly , and the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem or fail to understand it altogether "" . Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu , arguing that the variety of the poet 's work required consideration of his whole life , rather than the "" reductive "" categorizations used for more limited poets .","For instance , in his poem "" The Spring Festival of the Year of the Sheep "" ( ""Jiayou"" ), Du Fu writes of the people's yearning for a new year . This is not merely a literary device to describe the season , but also a metaphor for the people's longing for a new moral and social order . In this case , the poem is not only a celebration of the season but also a moral and social commentary .
