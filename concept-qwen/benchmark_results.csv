"[ CW ] Make me cry my eyes out in a single paragraph
","You walked into his office. You sat at your desk. Every day. Same routine. Turn on computer, open your inbox, check for assignments. Go home, go to sleep. Except tonight. Make a left turn. Down the alley, to the right. There's the door. Knock, no one answers. Open it, it's unlocked. Enter, see the table. Take the rope out of your bag, tie it on the pipe. Put the noose around your neck. This is it. One tear, rolls down to the floor. Deep breath, and jump right as the light turns on. Look up for your last sight to be your loved ones, all holding a birthday cake... for you.

","`` Lock!'' I threw myself backward onto the metal grate floor and crawled helplessly backward away from the thick metal door that hissed loudly as it sealed. A heartbeat later a resounding thud echoed around the small corridor, then another- and another- Then an unending screech that, even through the thick metal cut through me so deeply I thought it would make my ears bleed. 
 
 What the *fuck* was that- that- *thing*. It looked somewhat human, two legs, about the same length torso, a head, neck. It's about there that the similarities ended though- from the glimpse of it I'd seen it looked like a nightmarish Amputee- A steaming pile of *stinking* flesh that screeched and ran, and cut. Oh God- the cutting- How could I even forget for a second the cutting. 
 
 It had moved quickly- and silently at first. If it had n't been for the motion-triggered lights inside the compound I would n't have stood a fucking chance. 
 
 The facility has only a limited power supply so to try and make sure that no power was wasted the system was designed to waste nothing- That meant that the facility was plunged into darkness until someone moved into the area when the system would turn on the lights. 
 
 I'd been making my way from the cafeteria to the med-station, Eve had been sick lately- Gone off her food for four or five days now, but PotPie was her favourite so maybe I could tempt her... 
 
 Then the lights came on at the end of the corridor. Illuminating the doors to the surgery in a frame of black, I felt uneasy- then the next light flickered into life a few feet closer to me. What- a malfunction? The lights were only supposed to react to motion. 
 
 I squinted into the darkness as another light flickered on, my unease shifted to nervousness- maybe fear. I continued to search the dark between me and the slowly advancing light. 
 
 Then blackness. I'd been stood still- staring for a few seconds too long, the and the motion detector deactivated the light above me, I felt my heart skip as I glanced up and heart the wirr of the sensor flickering the light back into action- 
 
 A screech rocked the hallway and suddenly in my peripheral vision I saw a black mass fall from the cieling casting a black silouette against the light of the surgery doors. I snapped my head to it's direction and waited horrific seconds for the light to activate above it. 
 
 Too late- In a burst of speed it tore it's way toward me with powerful legs and that hellish screech. On instinct I screamed and tumbled backward, `` Shut!'' 
 
 The metal door closed from the ceiling with nightmare-like slowness, all the while I could see the lights flickering on down the hall, and the creatures silouette advancing quickly. 
 
 Two legs. 
 
 A head. 
 
 A neck. 
 
 A torso. 
 
 Human? That tail flailing behind it- cutting deep into the thick metal of the compound wall creating a horrible screech of torn metal as it lashed back and forward- was that where the sound had come from- I did n't care. 
 
 `` Lock!'' The door hissed as the lock engaged- a heartbeat later the beast thudded heavily into the metal- that screech of torn metal... Would the door even slow it down?

"[ WP ] Your parents have decided that they 're going to trade you in rather than renew .
","`` Welcome to KidStop, my name is Dan. Have you heard about our special offer this week? If you buy any 2 used Indonesian childern you get the 3rd for free!'' 
 
 `` No thank you'' my father responded kindly as he entered the store carrying a large box in his hands. 
 
 `` Well maybe you would be interested in our pre-order special. The newest blonde hair blue eyed child edition is coming out next week. Pre-order now and get 10 % off all other in store purchases!.'' 
 
 My father looked at the salesman with an interested expression. He then placed the box he was carrying on the counter and opened it's flaps. 
 
 `` I'd like to know if its still possible to trade this in.'' My father then lifted me from the box and handed me to the salesman. My body was bound in plastic wrap with a gag in my mouth preventing me from making any noise. I had been drugged so all I could do was watch and listen. 
 
 `` Ah! The older suburban soccer kid edition.'' Dan, said as he examined me. `` I remember when we sold these about 10 years ago. Great playing ability, quality design. These kids flew off the shelves when they first came out. What makes you want to trade him in?'' 
 
 My father then lifted my shirt to reveal a portion of my torso. `` My kid got the red ring of death the other day.'' He pointed to a large redish patch of skin on my chest. `` He ca n't do anything useful or even play anymore.'' 
 
 The sales man eyed the patch with a gloomy expression. `` Yeah, the red ring of death was common in these. We prefer to go by its more technical name, cancer. Once they get it its almost impossible to fix unless your willing to spend a ton of money.'' 
 
 `` So what can I get for him?'' My father asked as the salesman continued to examine me. 
 
 `` Well I ca n't trade him in. It's way past his warantee and we ca n't resell him like this. But I'll tell ya what, I'll take him off your hands and give you a 15 % discount on any of our new models.'' 
 
 My father stared at me, as if debating what he should do. 
 
 `` Deal!'' My father said as he shook the salesmans hand. `` Now tell me more about this new blonde hair blue eyed model.'' 
 
 My father continued talking with the saleman but I could n't hear about what anymore. I had been handed off to another employee who carried me to the back of the store. I was thrown into a box labeled spare parts with a couple other used childern. The top was shut and I could here the sound of packaging tape sealing us in as the light faded.
","You have to go to a university in order to be able to go to the same place as your parents . So, what is the best way to do that ?

"[ WP ] : Children are named by the traits they are fated to have - Brave , Serene , Deeply Caring , Unmoved - and of course your lovely daughter , Bites People .
","I heard a thump, and then Wealthy screamed his little heart out. I rushed down the hallway and into his room, and Bites People was already kneeling by him, his leg in her hands. 
 
 `` You. Off.'' I shouted at her, and she swiftly sulked back toward the closet. I knelt down to look at his scraped-up knee. His cries had slowed to whimpers as I asked him what happened. 
 
 `` We... \**sniff*\* were playing... \**sniff*\* an' I tripped over the castle... \**sniff*\* an' I landed on a lego... \**sniff*\* and the carpet burned my knee!'' 
 
 I scooped him up in my arms and headed for the medicine cabinet. `` Oh, sweet baby boy, Mom'll fix it.'' I said. His face lit up and he shouted `` Bitey's a doctor! She can fix it!'' I glanced back at Bites People, still sulking in the corner. *God, I hate when I snap at her. * 
 
 `` What do you say, Doctor Bites People? Can he be saved?'' She bit her lip and grinned. `` I need a band-aid and a sucker, stat!'' she shouted, running past me into the bathroom. I set Wealthy up on the counter and she immediately went to work alternately dabbing his knee with a wet cloth and blowing on it. We did n't have any suckers left so I grabbed a popsicle for each of us, orange green and red. When I returned the bandage was on and she was just bending down to kiss it better. I stifled the urge to pull her away. *He's five, after all. * I thought. *If she was going to bite him, she'd have done it already. * She'd never bitten anyone, not in all of her eight years on this earth so far. Maybe it was the precautions we put in place to stop her doing it, or... maybe she had no intention of biting anyone in the first place. 
 
 Could Oracle have been wrong? Having an off day? When she named me Worrier, did she *predict* I'd be a worrier, or did she doom me to be one by naming me such? Maybe we're all just self-fulfilling prophesies. Maybe President would still be President if he were named Reads Books. Then there's that! I knew a Reads Books in high school and he did n't really read *that* many books. I never outpaced him, but others did- Precocious, Scientist... even Cheerleader! 
 
 `` I'm sorry I snapped at you. I know you were trying to help.'' I told her, and she paused her slurping on her popsicle to say `` It's okay, I know.'' I gave her a cautious hug, then pulled away - just in case. 
 
 We decided to watch a movie after that, but I could n't shake these thoughts. Wealthy simply adores her, and she's a wonderful big sister. I should n't be so scared of her, but what if Oracle was right? I wish I did n't worry so much.

"[ WP ] A time traveler who has no control over his abilities meets his friend , the immortal , for lunch .
","The streets smelled of horseshit and the air was choked by smog, and for a moment someone may have heard James McGregor pray that these were smells he wouldn ’ t need to get used to. As he looked upon the dilapidated brothel that towered in front of him he hoped it housed smells that weren ’ t so repugnant and better yet the solution to the dire straits he was in. 
 
 When his foot entered the door he knew that the brothel had already failed on the former as his nostrils were assaulted by the smell of sweat and damp walls. They tried to cover the smells with incense but it only made James light headed. Before he could walk any further a burly Irishman stood in his path brandishing a cricket bat. 
 
 ‘ Can I help you, boy? ’ 
 
 ‘ I-I ’ m, looking for a girl -- - ’ 
 
 ‘ Most men who come here are. ’ He chuckled ‘ what ’ s her name? ’ 
 
 ‘ H-her, her name is Seymour. ’ 
 
 ‘ Ah, Seymour I should have known. ’ James looked at him bewildered 
 
 ‘ She ’ s the most popular lass we got. She ’ s in the fourth room on your right there. ’ He pointed with the cricket bat. Walking towards it the man stood in his way again. ‘ Her time isn ’ t free, jock. ’ 
 ‘ Oh sorry, how much? ’ 
 
 ‘ One guinea. ’ 
 
 ‘ One guinea! ’ 
 
 ‘ I told ya, she ’ s popular. ’ James slapped the pound in the Irishman ’ s grubby hand with reluctance. 
 
 Surprisingly, the room was clean and nicely decorated. It was almost baron if not for a four-poster bed in the centre, a chest-of-drawers in the corner and a dressing table in the other. The room smelled a lot nicer than any other place he had been in the city, the smell of incense was not so poignant and the lime laced curtains combated much of the stench coming from the river Clyde. Seymour stood by the window looking down on busy the cobbled streets, with her elbow in one hand and a cigarette in the other. She looked classy James thought then again she always did. She spun around, her red hair glistened in the candle light as she did so and red lips smiled like cracked porcelain. 
 
 ‘ James! Such a pleasure to see you again. ’ She giggled ‘ Although I didn ’ t think I would meet you like this. ’ Neither did I thought James. ‘ You caught me just in time I was about to have lunch, would you care to join me? ’ 
 
 James spotted the glass wine decanter on her dressing table ‘ A liquid lunch by any chance? ’ 
 
 She giggled like a schoolgirl again ‘ You know me too well. ’ She poured the wine into a chalice and offered it to James. ‘ I don ’ t have the time, Seymour, I used the last of the money on me to speak to you I ’ m not gon na waste it drunk. ’ 
 
 ‘ The last of your money, how much Dara charge this time? ’ 
 
 ‘ A pound. ’ 
 
 ‘ A pound? Oh well, you can expect high demand for a woman who is eternally youthful, sterile and immune to syphilis. You might as well make the most of your time ’ she said as she put his hand under her dress. He pulled away. She looked at him in disgust. 
 
 ‘ You don ’ t want to drink, you don ’ t want to fuck, why the hell are you here? ’ 
 
 ‘ I need your help, Seymour. ’ His words caught the woman off guard, she chuckled then burst into laughter but this time she cackled like a witch. She laughed so hard she lost her footing and fell on the bed. Laying on her back she wiped the tears from her rosé cheeks. ‘ What could you possibly need from me? ’ 
 
 ‘ I ’ ve, I ’ ve lost my abilities. ’ 
 
 ‘ Oh so it ’ s like, like a man ’ s problem you ’ re having ’ she whispered as she pointed to his breeches. 
 
 ‘ No, my time traveling abilities. ’ He blushed 
 
 ‘ Time travel? How the hell am I supposed to help you with that. ’ She said after a gulp of wine. 
 
 ‘ You ’ ve lived longer than any other person on this planet, you must at least know someone who can get me back to the future. ’ 
 
 ‘ Honey, anyone I know who could give you back you ’ re abilities are dead and buried. ’ 
 
 ‘ What about that gypsy, the one that gave you your abilities, surely she must be immortal. ’ 
 
 She swirled the glass in her hand some wine spilled onto her scarlet corset. ‘ I ’ ve not heard from that woman since my first husband bought the elixir that saved my life. ’ 
 
 ‘ So she could still be alive? ’ 
 
 ‘ Fat chance, kid. Besides do you really want an elixir from Ursula? When George bought that potion from the old hag it was to save me from the plague not make me live for another 800 fucking years. If you ask me you ’ re better off staying put. ’ She took another sip. 
 
 ‘ I can ’ t stay here, I need to return home, I have a duty. ’ 
 
 ‘ You and your fucking duty, you know no one appointed you guardian of the fucking space-time continuum. ’ 
 
 ‘ Please Seymour, I can ’ t stay here. ’ 
 
 ‘ Why not? I have to and you fair off much better than me. Do you know how hard it is for a penniless widow with a barren womb in the 19th century? Stay here, get married have children, make the best of this place. Or… 
 
 ‘ Or what? ’ he could see those sapphire eyes glisten. 
 
 ‘ You could marry me. ’ 
 
 ‘ Marry you? ’ 
 
 ‘ Think about it could solve both our problems. I no longer have to be a penniless whore and you get to go back home. You still have that bank account in Florence don ’ t you? ’ 
 
 ‘ How do you plan to get me back home? ’ 
 
 Laying back on the silk covered bed, she began twirling her red locks between her fingers and smiling. And as the smile grew so did the fangs from her upper lip ‘ There is more than one way to skin a cat. ’
