"[ WP/EU ? ] Its the year 2025 , and NASA has landed the first group of people on Mars . They discover an alien illness that works similarly to Dead Space 's necromorph reanimation . ( Context on description )","`` Lock!'' I threw myself backward onto the metal grate floor and crawled helplessly backward away from the thick metal door that hissed loudly as it sealed. A heartbeat later a resounding thud echoed around the small corridor, then another- and another- Then an unending screech that, even through the thick metal cut through me so deeply I thought it would make my ears bleed. 
 
 What the *fuck* was that- that- *thing*. It looked somewhat human, two legs, about the same length torso, a head, neck. It's about there that the similarities ended though- from the glimpse of it I'd seen it looked like a nightmarish Amputee- A steaming pile of *stinking* flesh that screeched and ran, and cut. Oh God- the cutting- How could I even forget for a second the cutting. 
 
 It had moved quickly- and silently at first. If it had n't been for the motion-triggered lights inside the compound I would n't have stood a fucking chance. 
 
 The facility has only a limited power supply so to try and make sure that no power was wasted the system was designed to waste nothing- That meant that the facility was plunged into darkness until someone moved into the area when the system would turn on the lights. 
 
 I'd been making my way from the cafeteria to the med-station, Eve had been sick lately- Gone off her food for four or five days now, but PotPie was her favourite so maybe I could tempt her... 
 
 Then the lights came on at the end of the corridor. Illuminating the doors to the surgery in a frame of black, I felt uneasy- then the next light flickered into life a few feet closer to me. What- a malfunction? The lights were only supposed to react to motion. 
 
 I squinted into the darkness as another light flickered on, my unease shifted to nervousness- maybe fear. I continued to search the dark between me and the slowly advancing light. 
 
 Then blackness. I'd been stood still- staring for a few seconds too long, the and the motion detector deactivated the light above me, I felt my heart skip as I glanced up and heart the wirr of the sensor flickering the light back into action- 
 
 A screech rocked the hallway and suddenly in my peripheral vision I saw a black mass fall from the cieling casting a black silouette against the light of the surgery doors. I snapped my head to it's direction and waited horrific seconds for the light to activate above it. 
 
 Too late- In a burst of speed it tore it's way toward me with powerful legs and that hellish screech. On instinct I screamed and tumbled backward, `` Shut!'' 
 
 The metal door closed from the ceiling with nightmare-like slowness, all the while I could see the lights flickering on down the hall, and the creatures silouette advancing quickly. 
 
 Two legs. 
 
 A head. 
 
 A neck. 
 
 A torso. 
 
 Human? That tail flailing behind it- cutting deep into the thick metal of the compound wall creating a horrible screech of torn metal as it lashed back and forward- was that where the sound had come from- I did n't care. 
 
 `` Lock!'' The door hissed as the lock engaged- a heartbeat later the beast thudded heavily into the metal- that screech of torn metal... Would the door even slow it down?

 `` No thank you'' my father responded kindly as he entered the store carrying a large box in his hands. 
 
 `` Well maybe you would be interested in our pre-order special. The newest blonde hair blue eyed child edition is coming out next week. Pre-order now and get 10 % off all other in store purchases!.'' 
 
 My father looked at the salesman with an interested expression. He then placed the box he was carrying on the counter and opened it's flaps. 
 
 `` I'd like to know if its still possible to trade this in.'' My father then lifted me from the box and handed me to the salesman. My body was bound in plastic wrap with a gag in my mouth preventing me from making any noise. I had been drugged so all I could do was watch and listen. 
 
 `` Ah! The older suburban soccer kid edition.'' Dan, said as he examined me. `` I remember when we sold these about 10 years ago. Great playing ability, quality design. These kids flew off the shelves when they first came out. What makes you want to trade him in?'' 
 
 My father then lifted my shirt to reveal a portion of my torso. `` My kid got the red ring of death the other day.'' He pointed to a large redish patch of skin on my chest. `` He ca n't do anything useful or even play anymore.'' 
 
 The sales man eyed the patch with a gloomy expression. `` Yeah, the red ring of death was common in these. We prefer to go by its more technical name, cancer. Once they get it its almost impossible to fix unless your willing to spend a ton of money.'' 
 
 `` So what can I get for him?'' My father asked as the salesman continued to examine me. 
 
 `` Well I ca n't trade him in. It's way past his warantee and we ca n't resell him like this. But I'll tell ya what, I'll take him off your hands and give you a 15 % discount on any of our new models.'' 
 
 My father stared at me, as if debating what he should do. 
 
 `` Deal!'' My father said as he shook the salesmans hand. `` Now tell me more about this new blonde hair blue eyed model.'' 
 
 My father continued talking with the saleman but I could n't hear about what anymore. I had been handed off to another employee who carried me to the back of the store. I was thrown into a box labeled spare parts with a couple other used childern. The top was shut and I could here the sound of packaging tape sealing us in as the light faded.

"[ WP ] : Children are named by the traits they are fated to have - Brave , Serene , Deeply Caring , Unmoved - and of course your lovely daughter , Bites People .","I heard a thump, and then Wealthy screamed his little heart out. I rushed down the hallway and into his room, and Bites People was already kneeling by him, his leg in her hands. 
 
 `` You. Off.'' I shouted at her, and she swiftly sulked back toward the closet. I knelt down to look at his scraped-up knee. His cries had slowed to whimpers as I asked him what happened. 
 
 `` We... \**sniff*\* were playing... \**sniff*\* an' I tripped over the castle... \**sniff*\* an' I landed on a lego... \**sniff*\* and the carpet burned my knee!'' 
 
 I scooped him up in my arms and headed for the medicine cabinet. `` Oh, sweet baby boy, Mom'll fix it.'' I said. His face lit up and he shouted `` Bitey's a doctor! She can fix it!'' I glanced back at Bites People, still sulking in the corner. *God, I hate when I snap at her. * 
 
 `` What do you say, Doctor Bites People? Can he be saved?'' She bit her lip and grinned. `` I need a band-aid and a sucker, stat!'' she shouted, running past me into the bathroom. I set Wealthy up on the counter and she immediately went to work alternately dabbing his knee with a wet cloth and blowing on it. We did n't have any suckers left so I grabbed a popsicle for each of us, orange green and red. When I returned the bandage was on and she was just bending down to kiss it better. I stifled the urge to pull her away. *He's five, after all. * I thought. *If she was going to bite him, she'd have done it already. * She'd never bitten anyone, not in all of her eight years on this earth so far. Maybe it was the precautions we put in place to stop her doing it, or... maybe she had no intention of biting anyone in the first place. 
 
 Could Oracle have been wrong? Having an off day? When she named me Worrier, did she *predict* I'd be a worrier, or did she doom me to be one by naming me such? Maybe we're all just self-fulfilling prophesies. Maybe President would still be President if he were named Reads Books. Then there's that! I knew a Reads Books in high school and he did n't really read *that* many books. I never outpaced him, but others did- Precocious, Scientist... even Cheerleader! 
 
 `` I'm sorry I snapped at you. I know you were trying to help.'' I told her, and she paused her slurping on her popsicle to say `` It's okay, I know.'' I gave her a cautious hug, then pulled away - just in case. 
 
 We decided to watch a movie after that, but I could n't shake these thoughts. Wealthy simply adores her, and she's a wonderful big sister. I should n't be so scared of her, but what if Oracle was right? I wish I did n't worry so much.

"[ WP ] A time traveler who has no control over his abilities meets his friend , the immortal , for lunch .","The streets smelled of horseshit and the air was choked by smog, and for a moment someone may have heard James McGregor pray that these were smells he wouldn ’ t need to get used to. As he looked upon the dilapidated brothel that towered in front of him he hoped it housed smells that weren ’ t so repugnant and better yet the solution to the dire straits he was in. 
 
 When his foot entered the door he knew that the brothel had already failed on the former as his nostrils were assaulted by the smell of sweat and damp walls. They tried to cover the smells with incense but it only made James light headed. Before he could walk any further a burly Irishman stood in his path brandishing a cricket bat. 
 
 ‘ Can I help you, boy? ’ 
 
 ‘ I-I ’ m, looking for a girl -- - ’ 
 
 ‘ Most men who come here are. ’ He chuckled ‘ what ’ s her name? ’ 
 
 ‘ H-her, her name is Seymour. ’ 
 
 ‘ Ah, Seymour I should have known. ’ James looked at him bewildered 
 
 ‘ She ’ s the most popular lass we got. She ’ s in the fourth room on your right there. ’ He pointed with the cricket bat. Walking towards it the man stood in his way again. ‘ Her time isn ’ t free, jock. ’ 
 ‘ Oh sorry, how much? ’ 
 
 ‘ One guinea. ’ 
 
 ‘ One guinea! ’ 
 
 ‘ I told ya, she ’ s popular. ’ James slapped the pound in the Irishman ’ s grubby hand with reluctance. 
 
 Surprisingly, the room was clean and nicely decorated. It was almost baron if not for a four-poster bed in the centre, a chest-of-drawers in the corner and a dressing table in the other. The room smelled a lot nicer than any other place he had been in the city, the smell of incense was not so poignant and the lime laced curtains combated much of the stench coming from the river Clyde. Seymour stood by the window looking down on busy the cobbled streets, with her elbow in one hand and a cigarette in the other. She looked classy James thought then again she always did. She spun around, her red hair glistened in the candle light as she did so and red lips smiled like cracked porcelain. 
 
 ‘ James! Such a pleasure to see you again. ’ She giggled ‘ Although I didn ’ t think I would meet you like this. ’ Neither did I thought James. ‘ You caught me just in time I was about to have lunch, would you care to join me? ’ 
 
 James spotted the glass wine decanter on her dressing table ‘ A liquid lunch by any chance? ’ 
 
 She giggled like a schoolgirl again ‘ You know me too well. ’ She poured the wine into a chalice and offered it to James. ‘ I don ’ t have the time, Seymour, I used the last of the money on me to speak to you I ’ m not gon na waste it drunk. ’ 
 
 ‘ The last of your money, how much Dara charge this time? ’ 
 
 ‘ A pound. ’ 
 
 ‘ A pound? Oh well, you can expect high demand for a woman who is eternally youthful, sterile and immune to syphilis. You might as well make the most of your time ’ she said as she put his hand under her dress. He pulled away. She looked at him in disgust. 
 
 ‘ You don ’ t want to drink, you don ’ t want to fuck, why the hell are you here? ’ 
 
 ‘ I need your help, Seymour. ’ His words caught the woman off guard, she chuckled then burst into laughter but this time she cackled like a witch. She laughed so hard she lost her footing and fell on the bed. Laying on her back she wiped the tears from her rosé cheeks. ‘ What could you possibly need from me? ’ 
 
 ‘ I ’ ve, I ’ ve lost my abilities. ’ 
 
 ‘ Oh so it ’ s like, like a man ’ s problem you ’ re having ’ she whispered as she pointed to his breeches. 
 
 ‘ No, my time traveling abilities. ’ He blushed 
 
 ‘ Time travel? How the hell am I supposed to help you with that. ’ She said after a gulp of wine. 
 
 ‘ You ’ ve lived longer than any other person on this planet, you must at least know someone who can get me back to the future. ’ 
 
 ‘ Honey, anyone I know who could give you back you ’ re abilities are dead and buried. ’ 
 
 ‘ What about that gypsy, the one that gave you your abilities, surely she must be immortal. ’ 
 
 She swirled the glass in her hand some wine spilled onto her scarlet corset. ‘ I ’ ve not heard from that woman since my first husband bought the elixir that saved my life. ’ 
 
 ‘ So she could still be alive? ’ 
 
 ‘ Fat chance, kid. Besides do you really want an elixir from Ursula? When George bought that potion from the old hag it was to save me from the plague not make me live for another 800 fucking years. If you ask me you ’ re better off staying put. ’ She took another sip. 
 
 ‘ I can ’ t stay here, I need to return home, I have a duty. ’ 
 
 ‘ You and your fucking duty, you know no one appointed you guardian of the fucking space-time continuum. ’ 
 
 ‘ Please Seymour, I can ’ t stay here. ’ 
 
 ‘ Why not? I have to and you fair off much better than me. Do you know how hard it is for a penniless widow with a barren womb in the 19th century? Stay here, get married have children, make the best of this place. Or… 
 
 ‘ Or what? ’ he could see those sapphire eyes glisten. 
 
 ‘ You could marry me. ’ 
 
 ‘ Marry you? ’ 
 
 ‘ Think about it could solve both our problems. I no longer have to be a penniless whore and you get to go back home. You still have that bank account in Florence don ’ t you? ’ 
 
 ‘ How do you plan to get me back home? ’ 
 
 Laying back on the silk covered bed, she began twirling her red locks between her fingers and smiling. And as the smile grew so did the fangs from her upper lip ‘ There is more than one way to skin a cat. ’

 It started off normal, for every 10 births there was 10 deaths, it was life. It was normal. 
 
 However, a fifteen years ago, a woman was having a son, her husband in the room. And as soon as her son was born she looked right at her husband and said, `` I hope you die.'' Now, it's still not known whether or not the phrase was said in vain. But right when that baby started screaming her husband dropped dead. 
 
 Doctors were stunned, and could n't revive him. They thought maybe the woman had poisoned him, but when they found out she had n't, they started doing tests. 
 
 The woman in one group, other `` control'' subjects in the next. 
 
 The original woman was inseminated again, and the control women were already all pregnant. 
 
 On the day they had children, the original woman had another son, and she looked at the head scientist, who had taken her away from her first son and said `` It'll be you.'' 
 
 Same story as the husband, as soon as the baby cried he dropped dead. 
 
 The control women were different, one who had been raped was told to think of the person she hated the very most, the second was told to think of someone they loved but did not want dead and to say something along the lines of the original woman. 
 
 When their dates came, the second woman had a daughter, and her mother was in the room and she said straight to her mothers face, `` Exchanged for you.'' And nothing happened. 
 
 The other woman, her baby was born a week late, thought of her rapist who was in the next room over, when her son was born. And just like before he dropped dead. 
 
 More expirments were done, are still being done today, but it was decided that babies are a life for a life, and you must genuinely hate the person you want dead, or the `` curse'' will pick of someone random close by. 
 
 
 They never checked on the control group though, and I've noticed something strange. My son, the one I love so much, is starting to look and act exactly like his father. I do n't know if it's a coincidence, I do n't think it is, and I'm locking the doors at night, and talking to any girls her brings home. I've also thought about taking him back to the scientists. 
 
 Because I've noticed that he is the exact replica of the man I'murdered', my rapist.

"[ WP ] Stockholm syndrome , but the other way around .","Christopher checked the order again before he left the store. One double cheeseburger, one large fries, and a coke. Perfect, everything she had asked for. Scrunching the top of the bag closed he stepped out into the frigid wind flowing in off the river. Shrugging his coat high around his neck Christopher hurried on his way. Buildings hunched around him, past their prime, huddled together like old men protecting each other from the cold wind of the evening and the indifference of a world that had moved on. 
 
 
 
 Once this area had bustled with light, loud shouts, and accusations ringing through the air as ships were unloaded by strong limbed youths and stoic stevedores. Money had flown into the city then, over a dozen ships a day, docking and unloading, bringing endless fuel for the bright burning furnace of the city. Televisions, Cars, Whitegoods, all of it had moved through the docks, leaving a slick of good fortune on the ground, a layer of wealth anyone with a strong back and willingness had been able to harvest. Now with the ships gone the money had retreated uptown, leaving the waterfront bare, those same workers grizzled old men hunched around oil barrels for warmth. 
 
 
 
 That was how Christopher had found himself in this mess. Third generation dock worker, born to decline. Stamped from an outdated mold, tough men and tougher women, learning at the knees of their fathers to drive an industry forward that no longer wanted them. An outdated piece of machinery, a horse drawn buggy in a world of Cadillacs and Pickup trucks, useless before his time. What option did a kid like him have? No wonder he kept doing such stupid shit like this.

Jimmy ran the whole damn gang, from whippet like Nick with his sandy blond bowl cut and nervous laugh to hunched shouldered Jack, with his protruding gut and endlessly repeated meandering stories, everyone listened to Jimmy. Their own marching little Napolean, short, round and scary as all hell. 
 
 
 
 Jimmy was the guy with the plan, the mastermind, the dictator, the CEO of the whole fucking venture. One quick snatch, a growled phone call and then to wait. It was a perfect plan said Jimmy, no chance it could fail. Grab the only daughter of the richest family in the goddamn city and you better believe you were going to get paid. Christopher wasn ’ t so sure, he had seen to many movies end with cracking gunfire and blood-spattered brick to feel truly comfortable, but Jimmy ’ s immediate threat scared him worse than any imagined fate, so he did what he was told. So they waited. All of them crammed in this abandoned office, waiting a call that just had to come. 
 
 
 
 She waited with them. That softly spoken girl with her wispy blonde hair and sad frightened eyes. She sat hunched on a chair in the corner, knees drawn to her chest and watched them watch her, watched this pacing pack of gorillas strut around like they had a plan. Pretty little Jessica, 12 years old if she was a day, kind, gentle, what a sweet kid. So different from the clamoring brats Christopher was used to, loud brash girls like his own sister Kim, with her stringy brown hair and shrill little voice. Nah, Jessica was different, something more pure, a delicate bird caught in their coarse filthy trap. 
 
 
 
 Entering the loft once more Christopher nodded at Jack, sat leant against the wall on guard duty. He moved over to where Jessica waited, that same huddled pose in that same chair, waiting his return. They shared a little smile at his approach, her nose wrinkling as she could smell the crisp potatoes and melted fat of the meal. Poor kid, if only there was some way he could help her.

 Greg walked over to Phil and rubbed his coat. `` What material is this? It's not felt, is it?'' 
 
 `` No, it's wool.'' 
 
 `` Well, it's felt now!'' 
 
 Phil cracked his knuckles. Time to pull out the big guns. `` What's the difference between a piano, a tuna, and a pot of glue?''

 `` You can tuna piano...''

"[ WP ] A Man dies and expects to go either Heaven or Hell , only to be told by an Angel that he already was in Hell and now his punishment is over","I woke up to the sound of a door opening, and the last thing I remember was smelling smoke. I heard someone saying, `` I think he needs more clean up'', and then I felt a rush of calmness, as though my mind was soaked in a pristine waterfall. I asked the operator, `` Where am I, am I dead?''. He looked hesitant to answer. Noticing that nobody was around to answer me, he said `` Ya I guess, I think that is what you people call it''. I was confused and starting to struggle to escape but something mysteriously kept me from moving too much. The operator started to panic `` Woah Woah, okay do n't panic. I'll explain. You see, you were in, uhhm.. hell''. Oh wait let me stop with the cognitive inhibitors'' I felt another rush, this time, it was followed by a number of strange realizations, I thought to myself, `` Wait a minute, hell??, I do n't believe in heaven or hell, not even in God, wait.. was I wrong all this time, what about all the science I learnt, evolution...''. He seem to have heard my thoughts, and appeared to be fascinated. He answered, `` Ya, do n't worry, all of that is true, I guess, we can give you the full explanation, you see around 500,000 years ago, we initiated Project Efficient Rehabilitation, which..'' He was interrupted by a women,'' Wait are you even cleared to debrief the prisoners'' she said to the operator. He panicked and said `` I am sorry, he seemed to have a good grasp of things, so I thought I'll explain...''. `` You have got to FOLLOW protocol!'' she screamed, we had two other similar cases today. The operator said, `` Ya I heard a scientist farm exploded, apparently that is why we have so many of them now''. `` What are you even saying, you mean the fire in their place of learning'' said the women. She mumbled `` No wonder you failed Natural Prison Logistics'' as he left the room. 
 
 She turned to me, introduced herself `` Hi, I am Dr. BT. I will be Doctoring for you today, Please let me know if you do not understand me I'll try to frame things so that it is best understood by you, Ask me what ever question you have''. I mumbled `` What is Project Efficient Rehabilitation?''. She sighed, `` Okay, here it is, you see, around 500,000 years ago, we lost funding to construct mind vessels for non-conformant beings, so one of our research units came up with a cost effective plan to harness Level 2 planets to harbour the prisoners there. We somehow got it cleared by the Galactic Ethics Board, mainly thanks to the case made by the Director, Miss Lucy Fer, she got the approval and we seeded some potential species on your planet, with mutations that essentially create another room in their heads for our prisoners. So you were a scientist right, I think you guys called it the neocortex. The mutations were chosen such that neocortex kept increasing in size, but only if it succumbed to the penance the body imposed, such as reproduction, energy gathering etc.'' `` Penance??'' I confusedly asked. `` Oh sorry, I got too carried away'' `` Let me explain'', `` You see, the way evolution works, is things develop only if it is useful for survival, so the parasitic neocortex, was neurochemically slaved to the body's primal desires'', `` In this way, you see we get our automatic development of large number of vessels from evolution, but also, they satisfy the penance requirement for the crimes committed'' ``. She started to look at her watch, then suddenly someone peeped into the room and said `` We have almost fixed it''. Dr. BT then hurriedly finished `` So yeah, we now have a planet filled with vessels with the right penance requirement and living through the Darwinian struggle of the planet would be your punishment. Your time was up so you popped back to us''. She walked out to talk to the person outside the door. 
 
 I was unusually calm and started to take in all the information, as I heard people running around in the corridor. I thought if my life was supposed to be hell, then why was it not so bad then, I mean sure hardships of life do exist, we do not always get what we want, reproductive impulses do sometimes cause more trouble than good, but overall mankind learned to cooperate and give ourselves a good standard of living. Dr. BT then entered the door partially and answered my question after hearing my thoughts, `` Well yeah, Director Lucy became short handed due to funding cuts, so she sort of left your planet on autopilot, and you guys.. well stepped up with your enlightenment and scientific method, but for the majority of its existence the project was pretty successful at its job''. I was shocked, was humanity suppressed all those years, I mean we are essentially the same species as the stone age caveman, but we needed the time to develop, right?. A voice outside, yelled `` Its fixed'', she replied `` Finally, damn these funding issues'', She turned to me and said `` Okay now, the machine is fixed so, get ready'', `` What machine? ``, `` Uhmm.. what do you people call it again..., Ah yes, reincarnation, you see your term is not served completely yet, the time you lived through had to be discounted to be worth only 10 %, because you know,... the scientific progress etc., its okay do n't worry, the Director told me she initiated some recent changes that should send the ball rolling to bring the penance levels back up again, thank you for your cooperation, its always hard to control you people when the auto reincarnation machine is broken'' She then pushed a button and in a flood of confused emotions I gave out a final yell `` Will I remember....'' and went back to sleep.
",". So, the man is now in Heaven. But how is this possible? Why does the Angel say that the punishment is over? The answer is that the Angel did not say the punishment is over, but that the man is already in Heaven. So, the Angel is making a mistake. But then why does the Angel say that the punishment is over? What is the meaning of this? Is it possible that the man is not in Heaven, but in a different place? But if the man is in a different place, how does the Angel know that he is there?
